1. A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and other devices within a limited area â€” like your home, office, school, or a single building â€” so they can share data, resources, and services.

Key Points Scope
Small geographic area (few meters to a few kilometers).
Example: Wi-Fi in your home or Ethernet in an office.
Purpose

Share files, printers, applications.

Enable communication (email, chat, VoIP) inside the network.

Speed

Usually high-speed (100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or more).

Types

Wired LAN â†’ Uses Ethernet cables and switches.

Wireless LAN (WLAN) â†’ Uses Wi-Fi.

Devices Involved

Switch â†’ Connects devices in the LAN.

Router â†’ Connects LAN to other networks (like the Internet).

Access Point â†’ Provides wireless access.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
If your office has 20 computers, a printer, and a file server all connected via Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi to the same switch/router â€” thatâ€™s a LAN.

Quick Analogy:
Think of a LAN like the plumbing inside a single building.
All taps (devices) are connected to the same internal water pipes (network cables), sharing the same water source (data).

2. Wired LANs vs. Wireless LANs

1. Wired LAN

Connection Medium: Ethernet cables (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6).

Speed: Generally faster and more stable (1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or more).

Reliability: Very reliable with low interference.

Security: More secure physically â€” needs physical access to the network port.

Mobility: Limited â€” devices must be physically connected.

Installation Cost: Higher if cabling is complex; needs switches and ports.

Latency: Lower latency (better for gaming, VoIP, video conferencing).

2. Wireless LAN (WLAN)

Connection Medium: Wi-Fi (radio waves).

Speed: Slower than wired in most cases (depends on Wi-Fi standard: e.g., Wi-Fi 6 can be very fast).

Reliability: Can be affected by interference (walls, other devices).

Security: Needs strong encryption (WPA3, WPA2) to prevent unauthorized access.

Mobility: High â€” devices can connect from anywhere within coverage range.

Installation Cost: Lower â€” no cabling required for end devices.

Latency: Slightly higher than wired.

ðŸ’¡ Simple Analogy:

Wired LAN = Like a landline phone â€” stable, clear, but youâ€™re tied to one spot.

Wireless LAN = Like a mobile phone â€” you can move anywhere, but the signal might drop sometimes.

3. Wide Area Networks
A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that spans a large geographic area, connecting multiple smaller networks like LANs (Local Area Networks) and MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks).

Key Points about WAN

Coverage

Can connect cities, countries, or even continents.

Example: The Internet is the largest WAN.

Purpose

To connect distant offices, branches, or data centers.

Allow communication and resource sharing across long distances.

Connection Methods

Leased lines (e.g., MPLS)

Fiber optics

Satellite links

Cellular networks (4G, 5G)

Public internet with VPN for security

Ownership

Usually built and maintained by telecom service providers.

Organizations lease connectivity from these providers.

Speed

Varies based on technology; usually slower than LAN because of longer distances and more routing.

Example

A bank with branches in multiple cities uses a WAN to connect all branch LANs to its central data center for transaction processing.

Advantages

Enables global communication.

Centralized data access for distributed offices.

Supports remote work.

Disadvantages

Higher cost compared to LAN.

More complex to manage.

Can have higher latency.

Quick Analogy:
If a LAN is like your homeâ€™s internal plumbing, a WAN is like the interstate water pipeline connecting cities and towns.

4. IPv4 Addressing
IPv4 Addressing is the system used to uniquely identify devices on a network using 32-bit addresses.

Structure:

32 bits divided into 4 octets (8 bits each).
Written in dotted decimal notation â†’ e.g., 192.168.1.10
Each octet can have a value from 0 to 255.

Example:

Binary:  11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Decimal: 192.168.1.10

Address Classes :
Class A: First octet range 1â€“126, default subnet mask 255.0.0.0, used for large networks.
Class B: First octet range 128â€“191, default subnet mask 255.255.0.0, used for medium networks.
Class C: First octet range 192â€“223, default subnet mask 255.255.255.0, used for small networks.
Class D: First octet range 224â€“239, used for multicasting.
Class E: First octet range 240â€“255, reserved for experimental/research purposes.
Note: Addresses starting with 127 are reserved for loopback testing, e.g., 127.0.0.1.
Types of IPv4 Addresses
Public: Routable on the internet.
Private: Used within local networks (not routable on the internet).

Class A range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Class B range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Class C range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Loopback: 127.0.0.1 for internal testing.

APIPA: 169.254.x.x automatically assigned when DHCP is unavailable.
Subnet Mask
The subnet mask separates the network portion and host portion of an IP address.
Example:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 â†’ First 3 octets represent the network, last octet represents the host.

Limitations
IPv4 provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses.
The rapid growth of the internet caused address exhaustion, leading to the adoption of IPv6.

5. IPv6 Addressing
IPv6 Addressing is the system used to identify devices on a network using 128-bit addresses, designed to replace IPv4 and solve its address exhaustion problem.

Structure
128 bits divided into 8 groups of 16 bits each.
Written in hexadecimal notation, separated by colons â†’ e.g., 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329
Leading zeros in each block can be omitted, and consecutive blocks of zeros can be replaced with :: (only once in an address).
Shortened example: 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329
Address Types
Unicast: Identifies a single interface. Data is delivered to one specific device.
Multicast: Identifies a group of interfaces. Data is delivered to all members of the group.
Anycast: Assigned to multiple interfaces; data is delivered to the nearest one (based on routing).

Common Address Scopes
Global Unicast: Public IPv6 addresses routable on the internet (starts with 2 or 3).
Link-Local: Automatically assigned, used for communication within the same link or subnet (fe80::/10).
Unique Local Address (ULA): Private IPv6 addresses for internal networks (fc00::/7).
Loopback: ::1 for testing on the local device.
Unspecified Address: :: used when no address is assigned.

Benefits over IPv4 :
Vast address space: 2^128 unique addresses.
Built-in security with IPsec support.
More efficient routing and simplified packet processing.
No need for NAT (Network Address Translation).
Better support for mobile devices.
Example Breakdown
Example IPv6 address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
First part (2001:0db8:85a3) â†’ Network prefix.
Middle zeros (0000:0000) â†’ Can be shortened.
Last part (8a2e:0370:7334) â†’ Interface identifier.
